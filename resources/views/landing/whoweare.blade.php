					<h4>Republican Party Members</h4>
					<p>We are a group of traditional Republicans. We have been precinct chairs, poll workers, and just regular conservative voters. We elected representatives who promised to fulfill the party platform.</p>

					<h4>Unwilling to Accept Failure</h4>
					<p>We will not accept elected Republicans that work against the party's official platform or fail to move the planks of the party platform forward. Both the US Congress and the Texas Legislature have failed to conserve our values.</p>
