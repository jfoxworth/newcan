						<p class="mb-0">If you are a conservative Republican that is fed up with the lack of progress and wants to assist us in getting people elected that will push the party platform and core issues forward, you can <a href="/JoinUs">add your name and contact info to our database and tell us how your are willing to help</a>. By adding your name to our list as a supported, we can show current representatives the level of support we have for our core issues on both a national level and within their district. No info is shared with any representative or party.</p>

						<p>If you are willing to join our cause and work to phone bank, block walk, or work in another capacity, adding your name and skills will let people we are supporting find you and get your help.</p>

If you are running against someone who openly opposes common-sense immigration enforcement or openly supports affirmative action, then we will do our best to assist you where possible. This can include developing a web presence, giving advice, and organizing ground work.</p>
